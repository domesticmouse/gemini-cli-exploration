# Gemini CLI Exploration

This is a workshop exploring the capabilities of Gemini CLI.

## Requirements

You will need to have Node installed. I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install it.
You could also install it manually from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installing Gemini CLI

According to the official [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) docs, there are several ways to install it:

- Using npm: `npm install -g @gemini-cli/cli`
- Using Homebrew: `brew install gemini-cli`

My preferred approach is to use the following alias:

```bash
alias gemini="npx -y https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli"
```

This will update Gemini CLI to the latest version on every invocation.

## The workshop itself

The workshop is in the branches. Checkout branch `step-01` to get started.
